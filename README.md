## Overall Observations:

The dashboard reveals concerning gender disparities across various aspects of the employee lifecycle, from hiring to promotions and retention. This indicates a potential systemic issue within the organization.

# Key Insights:

## Hiring:

A significant gender imbalance exists in hiring, with only 41% of hires being female.
This disparity is more pronounced at higher levels like Director and above.
This suggests potential biases in recruitment processes, lack of female representation in talent pools, or systemic barriers to entry for women.

## Promotions:

Women are underrepresented in promotions across all levels.
The percentage of women promoted decreases as the job level increases.
This could be attributed to factors like the "leaky pipeline" (women leaving the company at various stages of their careers), lack of access to mentorship and sponsorship, or unconscious biases in promotion decisions.

## Turnover:

Women have a higher turnover rate than men, particularly at the Director level.
This suggests that women might be leaving the company at a higher rate due to factors like lack of work-life balance, lack of career development opportunities, or feelings of exclusion or discrimination

## Recommendations:

Conduct thorough investigations into the reasons behind the hiring and promotion disparities. This could involve analyzing applicant data, conducting employee surveys, and gathering feedback from managers and employees.
Implement initiatives to address the identified root causes of the gender imbalance. This could include unconscious bias training, mentorship programs, and targeted recruitment efforts.
Develop strategies to improve retention rates for women. This could involve creating a more inclusive and supportive work environment, offering flexible work arrangements, and providing opportunities for career development.

## Improvement:

Overall, the dashboard highlights a critical need for the organization to address the identified gender disparities and create a more equitable and inclusive work environment for women.
